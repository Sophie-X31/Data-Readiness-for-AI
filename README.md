# Data-Readiness-for-AI
A poster presenting accessible tools for maintaining data readiness throughout the AI lifecycle.

This project was created during my Data Science internship with Ontario Public Services (OPS), where I synthesized research on DRAI and compiled practical tools into a handbook for ML engineers. While the handbook isn't publicly available, I'm excited to share this poster with you. I hope you find it useful!
